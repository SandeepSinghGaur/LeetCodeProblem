/*
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
Given an integer A, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
The final list should be generated in such a way that the indices of the queens in each list should be in reverse lexicographical order.

Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 10

Input 1:

A = 4

Input 2:

A = 1

[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]


Output 1:

[
 [Q]
]
